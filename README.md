// # Story

// So here you, the main character, starts off on a journey to be the very best like no one ever was. First, you find a beyblade (hexagonal dipyramid) randomly on the side of the road. You decide to spin the beyblade because yolo and accidentally trigger a chain reaction of collisions with random objects which eventually sends a barrel (decagonal prism) tumbling towards you. Fearing for your life, you start running as far as you can and eventually reach a circus tent (undecagonal pyramid) where you spend the rest of your life selling peanuts to small children.
